# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about detail: "The idea came from an experience in a school. People donate a lot of books to their school which is a good thing. But the problem is the school got books which they don't need. It's a primary school but they received a lot teaching material for middle school and high school. So we came up with an idea that create an website that can help both donator and donee. Our website can match them up and make sure that people who want to donate their book can give it to people who really need it."
